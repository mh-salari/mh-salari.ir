In this study we introduced a standardized protocol for evaluating how lighting conditions affect head-mounted eye tracker accuracy. Testing SMI Eye Tracking Glasses 2 Wireless with 9 participants under low, moderate, and high illumination levels, we found that tracking accuracy is best when data recording occurs under the same lighting conditions used during calibration. Notably, calibration under moderate illumination provided the most consistent performance across all lighting environments.
