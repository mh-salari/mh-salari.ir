During the MSCA Doctoral Network Eyes4ICU Winter School 2, I had the opportunity to meet with Prof. Andrew Duchowski to discuss developments in eye-tracking research. Our conversation revisited questions that my PhD supervisor, Prof. Roman Bednarik, had asked Prof. Duchowski a decade ago in 2014, allowing us to explore how both his eye-tracking course and the field itself have evolved over the past ten years.
