A friend of mine who is a dentist reached out to me and asked for a tool that he can use to add landmarks to dental X-Rays images. He wanted a simple tool for that task that can be installed on Windows and has some features like a small magnifier. Also, he wanted to send this program to his colleagues so that they can help him with labeling his dataset.

At that time, we couldn't find any ready labeling tools that met all of his requirements, so I developed Noghteh for him.

Noghte was based on a MIT license tool that I found on GitHub years ago, and I cannot remember its name to cite it, and despite all of my efforts, I couldn't find it. I heavily modified that tool and added lots of features, and I took many steps for error handling so that the code can run smoothly on different systems.
