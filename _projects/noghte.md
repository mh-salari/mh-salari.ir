description: "A lightweight image annotation tool for placing landmarks on medical images."
---

Noghte was created when a dentist friend needed a specialized tool to place landmarks on dental X-ray images. He required something simple that could run on Windows, include a magnifier feature, and be shared with colleagues who were helping with dataset annotation.

After searching for existing tools and finding none that matched all requirements, I developed Noghte as a solution. The project began with an MIT-licensed codebase I found on GitHub (which I unfortunately can't remember to properly credit).

I extended the original tool with additional features and robust error handling to ensure it would work reliably across different systems, creating a practical solution for medical image annotation.
