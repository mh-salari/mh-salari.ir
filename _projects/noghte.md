A friend of mine, who is a dentist, reached out to me and asked for a tool that he can use to add landmarks to dental X-Rays images. He wanted a simple tool for that task that can be installed on Windows and has some features like a small magnifier. Also, he wanted to share this program with his colleagues so that they can help him with labeling his dataset.

At that time, we couldn't find any labeling tools that met all of his requirements, so I developed Noghteh for him.

Noghte developed based on a MIT license tool that I found on GitHub. Unfortunately, despite all of my efforts, I couldn't find it or remember its name to cite it.

I heavily modified that tool and added lots of features to it, and I took many steps for error handling so that the code can run smoothly on different systems.
