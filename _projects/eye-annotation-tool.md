I created the EyE Annotation Tool to precisely annotate pupil, iris, and eyelid contours in eye images. This tool features a clean interface for both manual and AI-assisted annotation. Its modular plugin system lets researchers easily integrate custom detection algorithms to accelerate the annotation process. This streamlined approach has made analyzing eye anatomy data significantly more efficient for our research.

Developed by vibe-coding with Claude 3.7 Sonnet :)
