WOTW was developed as a component of a larger project exploring AI applications in stock market analysis. The site monitored Telegram channels for mentions of Tehran stock market symbols and cryptocurrencies, creating a searchable database of this information.

The technical implementation combined several technologies: Telethon for accessing Telegram data, Elasticsearch for efficient storage and search functionality, Flask for the web backend, and a ResNet18 model for identifying analytical charts and graphs in images.

This platform simplified the research process by eliminating the need to manually search through numerous Telegram channels, saving considerable time for market researchers and investors.

The service was eventually discontinued due to server maintenance costs.
