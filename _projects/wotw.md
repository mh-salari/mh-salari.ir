description: "a website for searching Tehran stock market symbols and cryptocurrencies in Telegram channels"
---

I created this website as part of a bigger project that uses AI in the stock market. The purpose of this website was to monitor stock symbols in Telegram channels and allow users to search for Tehran stock market symbols and cryptocurrencies within these channels.

To make this possible, I used Telethon to download data from Telegram channels, Elasticsearch to store and search the data, Flask as the backend, and Restnet18-based image classification for detecting analytical images.

The website made it easy for users to find the information they needed without having to manually search through multiple channels. It was a simple and efficient solution that could save a lot of time and effort.

Unfortunately, I had to shut down this site as I didn't have enough money to maintain its server and I couldn't find any screenshot of its.
