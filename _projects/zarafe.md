description: A tool for time annotation of eye-tracking recordings from multiple manufacturers with gaze data visualization.
---

I developed Zarafe to simplify working with eye-tracking data from multiple manufacturers. Instead of using different systems for each device, I wanted one unified tool to do time annotation for eye-tracking recordings. The application loads videos with their corresponding gaze data files, displays gaze position overlays on each frame, and provides straightforward controls for creating time-based event markers. These annotations export easily to CSV for analysis, streamlining my workflow across different eye-tracking platforms without needing to switch between various software solutions.

Developed by vibe-coding with Claude 3.7 Sonnet :)
